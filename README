   README - PD csv parsers  
Just a few public-domain parsers for csv files.  
CSV parsers tend to be something that people often search for on the 'net. 
Although languages like Python and Ruby have built-in parsers for csv, there may 
be times when another solution is wanted or needed. 

As usual, the code here is released to the public domain. 
"Share and enjoy....... "  ;)
